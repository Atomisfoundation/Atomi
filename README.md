Why Atomis?

* We are the first privacy project with a focus on end to end acquistion, trading and storing of your cryptocurrency.

* No ICO. No treasury, and small 1.9% premine for development

* BTC emission schedule with 21mm total supply

* Mimblewimble scalability through efficient blockchain “cut-through” feature 

* Community-orientated and not coroporate or VC backed

* No trusted setup required and privacy by default


### Roadmap

Our roadmap is simple. We want to build the most robust decentralized exchange in wallet. We plan to add Ethereum and Bitcoin Cash as next assets to the atomic swaps feature.
